# Eye Exercise

### Description

This program shows two eyes in a web browser that follow the mouse's movement around the page. When the mouse is in the center of the page, the eyes look forward, but as the mouse moves toward the edges of the page, the eyes follow in whichever direction the mouse moves.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and load **index.html** in a browser.
2. Move your mouse around to see the eyes follow the mouse's movement.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Refactor:** I plan to refactor the current code to utilize an event listener instead of the event property as it is being used currently. This would make it more in line with current standards. While this will not change the current functionality of the code, it will make it more portable and accurate for wider use.
- **Styling:** I plan to improve the styling of the program to have more depth and colors. This would include color gradients and iris colors for the eyes.
